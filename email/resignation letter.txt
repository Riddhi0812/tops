Dear Manager sir,

This letter is to formally notify you that I’m resigning as a developer at tops. My last day will be two weeks from today on Wednesday, sept 29, 2024.
During the next two weeks, I’ll do everything possible to wrap up my duties and train other team members as needed. Please let me know if 
there’s anything else I can do to help out during the transition.
I wish the company continued success, and I hope to stay in touch in the future.

Sincerely,
Riddhi MehtaS

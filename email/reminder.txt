subject : leave reminder


dear mam,

I recently sent you a leave request for the week of 1st oct to 7th oct 2024. Iâ€™m hoping to book a holiday with my family. Could you please confirm whether my leave request has been granted?

Once I have your approval, I can book the holiday. Please let me know if you want to discuss my request as soon as possible.

Regards,
Riddhi Mehta
